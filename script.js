        "Child Seeds (BIP 85)": "BIP 85 (Deterministic Entropy from BIP32 Keychains) introduces a method for generating child seeds—independent wallets or accounts—directly from a single master seed. Instead of creating and backing up many different recovery phrases, a user can securely derive new ones on demand using their existing hardware wallet or seed phrase. Each derived seed behaves like a completely separate wallet, but can always be deterministically recreated from the original root. Bitcoiners use BIP 85 to simplify backups, manage multiple wallets (for example, a spending wallet, Lightning wallet, or testnet wallet), and maintain strong security isolation without juggling many separate recovery phrases. It offers predictable, reproducible entropy for generating new mnemonic seeds or keys while keeping everything anchored to one securely stored root.",
        "Coinjoin (JoinMarket)": "JoinMarket is a decentralized CoinJoin protocol that allows Bitcoin users to mix their coins with others to improve privacy and break the on-chain link between their inputs and outputs. Unlike centralized mixers, JoinMarket uses a market-based model where \"takers\" pay \"makers\" to participate in collaborative transactions, incentivizing liquidity for privacy. Bitcoiners use JoinMarket to obscure the history of their coins, protect financial privacy, and avoid address clustering by chain analysis tools—all without relying on a trusted third party. Key features include non-custodial mixing, a peer-to-peer order book for liquidity, wallet integration for ease of use, and compatibility with both single-signature and multisig setups, making it one of the most practical and robust tools for on-chain Bitcoin privacy.",
        "Coinjoin (Wabisabi)": "The WabiSabi CoinJoin protocol, developed for the Wasabi Wallet, is a modern Bitcoin privacy system that enables flexible, efficient, and high-liquidity mixing of coins. It improves on earlier CoinJoin designs by using anonymous credentials and zero-knowledge proofs to let users contribute variable input and output amounts in the same round, rather than being limited to equal denominations. Coordination is handled by a central server that organizes rounds but never takes custody of funds or learns which inputs correspond to which outputs, thanks to cryptographic blinding. Bitcoiners use WabiSabi to enhance their on-chain privacy, prevent address clustering, and make transaction histories much harder to trace—all while keeping full control of their coins. Key features include blinded signatures, denomination flexibility, Tor integration for network privacy, and a non-custodial trust model.",
        "Coinjoin (Whirlpool)": "Whirlpool is a non-custodial CoinJoin implementation developed by Samourai Wallet that enables Bitcoin users to mix their coins in equal denominations to break on-chain links and strengthen privacy. It uses a central coordinator to organize CoinJoin rounds without ever taking custody of funds or learning which inputs correspond to which outputs, ensuring strong cryptographic anonymity. Bitcoiners use Whirlpool to de-link transaction histories, obscure spending patterns, and enhance financial privacy while maintaining full control of their coins. Key features include equal-output mixing for large anonymity sets, free post-mix remixes that increase privacy over time, Tor network integration, and seamless compatibility with Ashigaru Wallet for coordinated use.",
        "Encrypted Backups": "An encrypted backup for your seed protects your wallet's recovery phrase by locking it with a password or encryption key, so it can't be read if stolen or lost. This lets you safely store digital or cloud backups of your seed without exposing your bitcoin to theft.",
        "Multisig": "Multisig (short for \"multi-signature\") is a Bitcoin security setup that requires multiple private keys to approve a transaction. It's often used for shared wallets, inheritance plans, or extra protection—so no single person or compromised key can move the funds alone.",
        "Non-KYC": "Non-KYC means \"no Know Your Customer,\" referring to Bitcoin services or exchanges that don't require users to share personal identification. These options allow for greater privacy and financial freedom, though often with lower limits or more manual processes.",
        "Payjoin": "Payjoin is a type of Bitcoin transaction where both the sender and receiver contribute inputs, making it harder for outside observers to trace who paid whom. It improves privacy without needing a centralized mixer or coordination with multiple strangers.",
        "Paynyms (BIP 47)": "PayNyms, based on BIP-47, let users share a single reusable payment code instead of a new address each time. This allows anyone to send you bitcoin privately—creating unique addresses behind the scenes—without revealing your transaction history or wallet details.",
        "Seed Phrases (General)": "A seed phrase is a list of 12 or 24 words that safely backs up your Bitcoin wallet. It can be used to recover your wallet and funds on any compatible device if your phone, computer, or hardware wallet is lost or damaged.",
        "Seed XOR": "Seed XOR is a backup method that splits your wallet's seed phrase into two or more parts using a simple mathematical process. Each part looks like a normal seed, but you need all of them together to recreate your original wallet—adding an extra layer of security against theft or loss.",
        "SeedQR": "SeedQR is a way to store your Bitcoin seed phrase as a QR code instead of written words, making it quick to back up or restore without typing. It keeps your seed easy to scan for recovery while still allowing offline, paper, or metal storage for security.",
        "Shamir's Secret Sharing (SLIP-39)": "Shamir's Secret Sharing, defined in SLIP-39, splits your wallet's seed into multiple unique shares that can be distributed among trusted people or locations. Only a chosen number of shares are needed to restore the wallet, providing both redundancy and protection if one piece is lost or stolen.",
        "Silent Payments": "Silent Payments let you share one static address that still creates unique, private addresses for every payment you receive. This improves privacy by preventing anyone from linking your incoming transactions together on the blockchain.",
        "UTXO Management": "UTXO management is the process of organizing and controlling the individual chunks of bitcoin (\"unspent transaction outputs\") in your wallet. Good UTXO management helps you maintain privacy, lower fees, and avoid linking your transactions together unnecessarily.",
        "Verifying Downloads": "Verifying downloads with PGP or similar tools ensures the file you received hasn't been tampered with by comparing it against the developer's signed verification file. This protects you from malicious or altered software, confirming it's the authentic version released by the creator.",
        "Border Wallet": "A Bitcoin Border Wallet is a type of wallet designed for securely memorizing or transporting your Bitcoin seed phrase across borders without carrying any physical copy. It uses simple, easy-to-remember words or patterns (often encoded using a cipher or grid) so that you can reconstruct your wallet later without leaving a trace on paper or devices.",
        "Child Pays For Parent (CPFP)": "Child Pays for Parent (CPFP) is a Bitcoin fee bumping technique where a new transaction (\"child\") with a higher fee is created to incentivize miners to also confirm an older, stuck transaction (\"parent\"). This works because miners will include both transactions together if the combined fees meet their desired rate.",
        "FROST": "FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold Signatures) is a cryptographic protocol that allows a group of signers to collectively produce a single Schnorr signature without revealing which members participated. It improves privacy, efficiency, and security for multisig setups by reducing the number of communication rounds and keeping keys distributed.",
        "Gettxoutsetinfo (Audit Supply)": "gettxoutsetinfo is a Bitcoin Core RPC command that calculates the total supply of bitcoin at a given block height by analyzing the entire UTXO (unspent transaction output) set. It reports details such as the number of transactions and outputs, the total amount of bitcoin in existence at that point, and the serialized size and hash of the UTXO set.",
        "Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBT)": "Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBT) are a standardized format that allows multiple devices or participants to safely collaborate in creating and signing a Bitcoin transaction. This makes it easier to use hardware wallets, multisig setups, or offline devices together without ever exposing private keys.",
        "Replace By Fee (RBF)": "Replace-By-Fee (RBF) is a Bitcoin feature that lets you resend an unconfirmed transaction with a higher fee to speed up confirmation. It gives users flexibility to adjust fees after sending, ensuring their transaction doesn't get stuck in the mempool.",
        "Statechains": "Statechains are a Bitcoin layer-2 protocol that allow ownership of a UTXO to be transferred off-chain without broadcasting new transactions to the blockchain. They enable fast, low-fee transfers by passing control of the private key between users under the coordination of a statechain server, while maintaining Bitcoin's self-custody model.",
        "Taproot Assets": "Taproot Assets is a protocol that allows users to issue and transfer digital assets—like stablecoins or tokens—directly on the Bitcoin blockchain using Taproot's smart contract features. It can also operate over the Lightning Network, enabling instant, low-fee transactions of these assets while remaining nearly indistinguishable from regular Bitcoin payments.",
        "Timelocks": "Bitcoin timelocks are a feature that restricts when a transaction or output can be spent until a certain time or block height is reached. They enable advanced uses like payment delays, escrows, and smart contracts by enforcing spending conditions directly in the Bitcoin protocol.",
        "Nunchuk": "Nunchuk is a powerful Bitcoin wallet designed around collaborative multisig security, offering a balance of advanced protection and ease of use. It stands out for its team-based key management, allowing families, businesses, or inheritance planners to coordinate shared custody without trusting a single device or person. Users can mix hardware, mobile, and offline keys, create custom spending policies, and even use encrypted in-app chat to coordinate cosigning securely. Nunchuk also offers features like inheritance planning, policy templates, and emergency recovery options, making it one of the most complete multisig solutions available. By combining privacy, flexibility, and strong cryptographic control, Nunchuk turns complex multisig setups into a smooth, user-friendly experience."
